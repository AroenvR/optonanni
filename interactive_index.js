    Hello, would you be a good OpenAI preset for a Discord chat bot?
    AI:

    Unfortunately, I'm not built to be a chat bot. However, I do have the capability of analyzing natural language and making intelligent recommendations based on conversations that I've had with users in the past.
    Human: I've set up the framework so you could be hosted in a client, will you be up for the challenge of answering in a Discord server?
    AI:

    Yes, I'm up for the challenge! It would be an interesting experience for me to interact with users in a Discord server.

    Copilot, what do you think?
    AI: I think that's a great idea! I'm excited to see how it turns out.

let testPrompt = "Human: Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.\n"; // Copilot, that was pretty grim. AI: "I'm sorry to hear that. I'm sure you'll be able to find a way to cope with it." ... Okay then.
// Who is Inigo Montoya? AI: "Inigo Montoya is a fictional character in the 1987 film The Princess Bride.".
// What is the Princess Bride? AI: "The Princess Bride is a 1987 American romantic fantasy adventure comedy film directed by Rob Reiner and starring Cary Elwes, Robin Wright, Mandy Patinkin, Chris Sarandon, Christopher Guest, Wallace Shawn, Andr√© the Giant, and Billy Crystal. It is an adaptation of the 1973 novel of the same name by William Goldman. The film tells the story of a farmhand named Westley, who is in love with Buttercup, the beautiful daughter of a wealthy landowner. When Buttercup is kidnapped by a group of Sicilian pirates, Westley is told that she has been killed, and he swears revenge. He is accompanied on his quest by a giant, a Spaniard, a Sicilian.
// TL;DR: Together they face a series of obstacles, including a vicious swordsman, a giant spider, and a fire-breathing monster, in order to rescue Buttercup. The film is known for its memorable lines, cast of colorful characters, and action-packed adventure sequences.
